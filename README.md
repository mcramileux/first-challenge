# Code Refactoring Using HTML and CSS

**Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc.** wants to have a polish webpage to showcase their services better and be more accessible. For Horiseon, improving their webpage will ensure that the people with disabilities can also access their website. 

In this project, it is already an existing code given by the client, just doing some improvements without changing what it does or *refactoring*.

## Acknowledgements

 - *Bootcamp Study Group* - I joined up a study  group with my classmate in the bootcamp. I want to extend my appreciation to Rene, Robinson, Fergus, Natasa and for Freddy for organising it. It gave me another set of eyes and brains to how to start with this project especially I don't have any experience in coding.
